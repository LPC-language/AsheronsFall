An Asheron's Call server implemented in LPC.  The client software can be
downloaded here:

    <http://content.turbine.com/sites/clientdl/ac1/ac1install.exe>

To run the emulator, you'll need DGD.

    <https://github.com/dworkin/dgd>

If you don't want to compile DGD yourself, you can also use Hydra, a binary
of which can be downloaded from:

    <http://ftp.dworkin.nl/hydra/>

You will also need the Cloud Server library:

    <https://github.com/dworkin/cloud-server>

Either copy or create a softlink from AsheronsFall/src to 
cloud-server/src/usr/Asheron.  Next, create softlinks or copy the client
files "client_cell_1.dat" and "client_portal.dat" to AsheronsFall/src/dat/data.

After starting the server, you can connect to it with

    acclient.exe -h 127.0.0.1 -p 9000 -a accountName --glsticketdirect password
